# Section 3.6.1: The Basic switch Statement

Notes

- A switch statement allows you to test the value of an expression and, depending on that value, to jump directly to some location within the switch statement
- Only expressions of certain types can be used. 
	- The value of the expression can be one of the primitive integer types int, short, or byte. 
	- It can be the primitive char type. It can be String. Or it can be an enum type
- The expression cannot be a double or float value.
- The positions within a switch statement to which it can jump are marked with case labelsB
	- "case constant:"
	- note that the constant is a literal of the same type as the expression in the switch
	- A case label marks the position the computer jumps to when the expression evaluates to the given constant value
	- You can also use the label “default:” in a switch statement; this provides a default jump point that is used when the value of the expression is not listed in any case label





- This has exactly the same effect as the following multiway if statement, 
	- but the switch statement can be more efficient because the computer can evaluate one expression and jump directly to the correct case, 
	- whereas in the if statement, the computer must evaluate up to N expressions before it knows which set of statements to execute
- The break statements in the switch are not actually required by the syntax of the switch statement. 
	- is to make the computer jump past the end of the switch statement, skipping over all the remaining cases.
- CAREFUL: If you leave out the break statement, the computer will just forge ahead after completing one case and will execute the statements associated with the next case label. This is rarely what you want, but it is legal.
	- SIDENOTE: the break statement is sometimes replaced by a return statement, which terminates the subroutine as well as the switch
- NOTE: theconstants in the case labels don’t have to be in any particular order, but they must all be different
