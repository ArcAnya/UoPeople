# Section 3.6.1: The Basic switch Statement

Notes

- To test value of expression & jump directly to some location within switch statement
- Can be primitive integer types int, short, or byte, and  char, String or enum type.
- Cannot be double or float 
- Positions = marked by case labels = position computer jumps to when expr evaluates to it
	- Constant = literal of same type as expression in switch
	- Label “default:”  = default jump point

```
switch(<expression>) {
	case <constant-1>:
		<statements-1>
		break;
	case <constant-2>:
		<statements-2>
		break;
	... // (more cases)
	case <constant-N>:
		<statements-N>
		break;
	default: // optional default case
		<statements-N+1>
}
```

- Switch statement can be more efficient than multiway if statement because can evaluate expression and jump directly to correct case. Whereas in the if statement, the computer must evaluate up to N expressions before it knows which set of statements to execute
- Break statements in switch = not actually required =>  to jump past end of switch statement, skipping over all remaining cases.
- CAREFUL: when no break statement, computer will execute statements associated with next case label. Rarely what you want, but = legal.
- SIDENOTE: break statement sometimes replaced by return statement => terminates subroutine as well as switch
- NOTE: constants in case labels must all be different
